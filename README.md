## Markdown Basics
### Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. Only use 2 to 6 hashtags

### Paragraphs
Text can be entered to be inserted in a normal paragraph (This is mostly what i think you'll be doing)

### Line Break
End the line with 2 spaces and then press enter/return.  
This is done above.

### **Bold** and *italic* Text
Use double asteriks (**) before and after the letters/words you want to bold. 
Use single asteriks (*) before and after the letters/words you want to italicize. 


### Blockquotes 
> This is what a blockquote looks like, it is created by begining the line with >

> Multiline blockquotes can be created by starting each consequtive line with >
>
> this is a multiline blockquote

### Lists
#### Numbered lists
1. Start lines with a number followed by a period (1.)
2. This is line 2

#### Dot pointed lists
* Start each line with either an asteriks 
- or a minus sign 
+ or plus sign  

#### Indented Lists
Lists (numbered or dot points), can be indented simply by indenting them.
