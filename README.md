To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. Only use 2 to 6 hashtags

#### Paragraphs
Text can be entered to be inserted in a normal paragraph (This is mostly what i think you'll be doing)

#### Line Break
End the line with 2 spaces and then press enter/return.  
This is done above.

#### **Bold** and *italic* Text
Use double asteriks (**) before and after the letters/words you want to bold. 
Use single asteriks (*) before and after the letters/words you want to italicize. 

#### Blockquotes
